Time and Calendar Exercise
Overview
Create a system of classes to represent time, dates, and appointments in a calendar application.

Part 1: Time Class
First, create a Time class similar to the example in previous chapters:

Create a Time class with attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds
Add a __str__ method that formats the time as "HH:MM:SS"
Write a method is_valid that checks if the time is valid (hours 0-23, minutes 0-59, seconds 0-59)
Implement a __lt__ method to compare times chronologically
Add methods to add and subtract times, ensuring proper carry/borrow operations
Part 2: Date Class
Create a Date class to represent calendar dates:

Initialize with year, month, and day attributes
Add a __str__ method that formats the date as "YYYY-MM-DD"
Write a method is_valid that checks if the date is valid (considering month lengths and leap years)
Implement __lt__ to compare dates chronologically
Add a method to calculate the day of the week for any date
Part 3: Appointment Class
Create an Appointment class that inherits from both Date and Time:

Create a new class DateTime that combines date and time information
Create an Appointment class that inherits from DateTime and adds:
A title attribute
A duration attribute (in minutes)
A location attribute
A description attribute
Add a method conflicts_with that checks if two appointments overlap
Implement a __str__ method to format the appointment information nicely
Part 4: Calendar Class
Create a Calendar class to manage a collection of appointments:

Initialize with a name and an empty list of appointments
Add methods to add and remove appointments
Create a method to find all appointments on a given date
Implement a method to find conflicts among all appointments
Add a method to print a formatted daily or weekly view of appointments
Part 5: Specialized Calendar Types
Create at least two specialized calendar types that inherit from Calendar:

WorkCalendar - with methods specific to work appointments
SchoolCalendar - with methods specific to academic appointments
Each specialized calendar might have its own rules about valid appointment times, conflict resolution, or display formats.

Testing
Create a script that demonstrates all features of your calendar system:

Create instances of different times, dates, and appointments
Test the validation methods
Test for appointment conflicts
Create specialized calendars and demonstrate their unique features
This exercise gives you practice with:

Multiple inheritance
Method overriding
Date and time manipulation
Complex validation logic
Designing a coherent class hierarchy
Submit your solution as well-documented Python code with appropriate comments and test cases.
